Agent: "Let me check availability for tomorrow..."
[Agent calls check_availability function]
Agent: "I have 2pm and 4pm available. Which works better?"
Customer: "2pm please. I'm John Doe, john@example.com"
[Agent calls book_appointment function]
Agent: "Perfect! I've booked your appointment for tomorrow at 2pm.
       You'll receive a calendar invite shortly."
[Google Calendar sends automatic email invite]
```
