# Task 2.2: CRM Integration Within LiveKit Framework - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Task Completion Status: COMPLETED

**Task:** 2.2 CRM Integration Within LiveKit Framework

**Requirements Met:**

- ✅ Build CRM connector as LiveKit agent action
- ✅ Implement customer identification via phone number lookup
- ✅ Create real-time customer record access during calls
- ✅ Build interaction logging and ticket creation workflows
- ✅ Set up seamless handoff to human agents
- ✅ Requirements: 4.1, 2.5

## 🏗️ Implementation Overview

### 1. CRM Connector Architecture

**File:** `crm_integration.py`

- **CRMConnector Class**: Core CRM integration with full CRUD operations
- **CRMAction Class**: LiveKit agent action wrapper for voice agent integration
- **Data Models**: CustomerInfo, SupportTicket, InteractionLog with proper typing
- **Demo Data**: Pre-loaded customer database for testing and development

### 2. Customer Identification System

**Phone Number Lookup:**

```python
async def get_customer_by_phone(self, phone: str) -> Optional[CustomerInfo]:
    # Real-time customer lookup during calls
    # Returns complete customer profile with history
```

**Features Implemented:**

- ✅ Real-time phone number lookup
- ✅ Customer profile retrieval with full history
- ✅ Account status and preferences access
- ✅ Previous appointments and support history
- ✅ Company and contact information

### 3. Real-Time Customer Record Access

**Integration Points:**

- **Support Agent Module**: Enhanced with CRM customer context
- **Voice Agent Pipeline**: Customer info available throughout conversation
- **Session Management**: Customer data persisted across conversation turns

**Customer Context Enhancement:**

```python
enhanced_context = {
    'customer_info': {
        'name': customer_info.name,
        'company': customer_info.company,
        'account_status': customer_info.account_status,
        'previous_appointments': customer_info.previous_appointments,
        'support_history': customer_info.support_history,
        'preferences': customer_info.preferences
    }
}
```

### 4. Interaction Logging and Ticket Creation

**Automatic Interaction Logging:**

- ✅ Every customer call logged to CRM
- ✅ Session ID tracking for conversation continuity
- ✅ Duration, outcome, and summary capture
- ✅ Follow-up requirements flagging

**Smart Ticket Creation:**

- ✅ Automatic ticket creation for issues and escalations
- ✅ Priority assignment based on keywords and customer status
- ✅ Detailed context preservation in ticket descriptions
- ✅ Integration with customer support history

**Ticket Creation Logic:**

```python
def _should_create_ticket(self, message: str, response_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    # Create ticket for escalations or unresolved issues
    if response_data.get('escalation_needed'):
        return True

    # Create ticket for specific keywords indicating issues
    issue_keywords = ['problem', 'issue', 'error', 'broken', 'not working', 'complaint', 'billing', 'refund']
    return any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in issue_keywords)
```

### 5. Seamless Human Agent Handoff

**Escalation System:**

- ✅ Automatic escalation detection based on conversation context
- ✅ Complete conversation history preservation
- ✅ Customer context transfer to human agents
- ✅ Priority-based escalation routing
- ✅ Support ticket creation for escalated calls

**Escalation Features:**

```python
async def escalate_to_human(self, session_id: str, customer_id: str,
                          escalation_reason: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Creates escalation record with full context
    # Triggers human agent notification (production ready)
    # Creates high-priority support ticket
    # Preserves conversation state for handoff
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### CRM Data Models

**CustomerInfo:**

- Customer ID, name, phone, email
- Company and account status
- Previous appointments and support history
- Communication preferences
- Last contact tracking

**SupportTicket:**

- Unique ticket ID with priority and status
- Customer association and categorization
- Creation and update timestamps
- Resolution notes and assigned agent tracking
- Conversation context preservation

**InteractionLog:**

- Comprehensive call logging
- Session tracking and duration capture
- Outcome classification and follow-up flags
- Multi-channel support (voice, chat, email)

### Integration with Support Agent

**Enhanced Support Agent Module:**

```python
class SupportAgentModule:
    def __init__(self, llm_instance, knowledge_dir: str = "knowledge_base",
                 crm_api_url: str = None, crm_api_key: str = None):
        # Integrated CRM connector and action wrapper
        self.crm_connector = CRMConnector(crm_api_url, crm_api_key)
        self.crm_action = CRMAction(self.crm_connector)
```

**Real-Time Customer Context:**

- Customer lookup on every call initiation
- Enhanced RAG responses with customer history
- Automatic interaction logging
- Smart ticket creation and escalation handling

### Configuration Integration

**Updated Configuration:**

```python
@dataclass
class CRMConfig:
    api_url: Optional[str]
    api_key: Optional[str]
```

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
CRM_API_URL=https://your-crm-api.com
CRM_API_KEY=your-crm-api-key
```
