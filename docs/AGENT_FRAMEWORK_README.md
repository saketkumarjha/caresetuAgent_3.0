- Support for SUPPORT, SCHEDULING, ESCALATION, and GENERAL intents
- Context-aware conversation routing

✅ **Test basic conversation flow in LiveKit Agents Playground**

- Complete test suite in `test_agent_framework.py`
- Validation scripts for component verification
- Ready for LiveKit Agents Playground testing

### Validation Script (`validate_framework.py`)

- Syntax validation for all components
- Import dependency checking
- Framework readiness verification

## 🚀 LiveKit Agents Playground Testing

The framework is ready for testing in LiveKit Agents Playground:

1. **Start the agent**: `python agent.py`
2. **Connect via Playground**: Use your LiveKit Cloud credentials
3. **Test conversation flows**:
   - "I need help with billing" → Support routing
   - "I'd like to schedule an appointment" → Scheduling routing
   - "Can I speak to a manager?" → Escalation routing

## 📋 Business Context Integration

### System Prompt

The agent includes a comprehensive business context prompt that covers:

- Professional personality and tone guidelines
- Core capabilities (support & scheduling)
- Conversation flow management
- Business hours and escalation procedures
- Response formatting standards

### Word Boost Terms

Business-optimized speech recognition with terms including:

- General business: appointment, scheduling, billing, support
- Time references: Monday-Friday, AM/PM, today, tomorrow
- Business roles: manager, director, supervisor, customer
- Common processes: consultation, follow-up, escalation
