Fix for agent.py issues

This file explains the issues found in agent.py and how to fix them.
"""

# Issues found in agent.py:

# 1. Duplicate code blocks in calendar handling methods
#    - Multiple copies of the same methods appear in the file
#    - This causes syntax errors as methods are defined multiple times

# 2. Incomplete method implementations due to code duplication
#    - Some methods are cut off in the middle due to duplication

# 3. Reference to non-existent method
#    - There's a reference to `_get_scheduling_help()` that should be `_get_calendar_help()`

# How to fix:

# 1. Use the agent_calendar_fixes.py file which contains corrected versions of:
#    - detect_calendar_intent
#    - handle_calendar_request
#    - _handle_availability_check
#    - _handle_booking_request
#    - _handle_cancellation_request
#    - _handle_reschedule_request
#    - _get_calendar_help (renamed from _get_scheduling_help)
#    - quick_book_appointment

# 2. Import these methods into the BusinessVoiceAgent class:
#    from agent_calendar_fixes import (
#        detect_calendar_intent,
#        handle_calendar_request,
#        _handle_availability_check,
#        _handle_booking_request,
#        _handle_cancellation_request,
#        _handle_reschedule_request,
#        _get_calendar_help,
#        quick_book_appointment
#    )

# 3. Add these methods to the class:
#    BusinessVoiceAgent.detect_calendar_intent = detect_calendar_intent
#    BusinessVoiceAgent.handle_calendar_request = handle_calendar_request
#    BusinessVoiceAgent._handle_availability_check = _handle_availability_check
#    BusinessVoiceAgent._handle_booking_request = _handle_booking_request
#    BusinessVoiceAgent._handle_cancellation_request = _handle_cancellation_request
#    BusinessVoiceAgent._handle_reschedule_request = _handle_reschedule_request
#    BusinessVoiceAgent._get_calendar_help = _get_calendar_help
#    BusinessVoiceAgent.quick_book_appointment = quick_book_appointment

# 4. Alternatively, you can use the agent_clean.py file which has all the fixes integrated

# Example of how to apply the fix:
"""
# At the top of agent.py, add:
from agent_calendar_fixes import (
    detect_calendar_intent,
    handle_calendar_request,
    _handle_availability_check,
    _handle_booking_request,
    _handle_cancellation_request,
    _handle_reschedule_request,
    _get_calendar_help,
    quick_book_appointment
)

# Then in the BusinessVoiceAgent class definition, add:
class BusinessVoiceAgent(Agent):
    # Add calendar methods to the class
    detect_calendar_intent = detect_calendar_intent
    handle_calendar_request = handle_calendar_request
    _handle_availability_check = _handle_availability_check
    _handle_booking_request = _handle_booking_request
    _handle_cancellation_request = _handle_cancellation_request
    _handle_reschedule_request = _handle_reschedule_request
    _get_calendar_help = _get_calendar_help
    quick_book_appointment = quick_book_appointment
    
    # Rest of the class...

# You can also use the livekit_calendar_actions.py file for a more comprehensive
# implementation of calendar actions that can be used with the LiveKit agent framework.
