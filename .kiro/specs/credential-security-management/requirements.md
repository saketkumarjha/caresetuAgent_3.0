# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement a secure credential management system for the application, addressing the current issue of exposed Google OAuth credentials in the repository. The system will provide a secure way to store, access, and manage sensitive credentials while preventing them from being committed to version control systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to securely store API credentials and secrets, so that they are not exposed in the repository.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are needed by the application THEN the system SHALL retrieve them from a secure location outside of version control.
2. WHEN new credentials are added THEN the system SHALL store them securely without exposing them in the repository.
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to securely access credentials in each environment.
4. IF credentials are accidentally committed to the repository THEN the system SHALL provide a process to remove them and secure the repository.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear guidelines on handling credentials, so that I can follow best practices for security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new developer joins the project THEN the system SHALL provide documentation on how to set up and manage credentials.
2. WHEN credentials need to be updated THEN the system SHALL provide a secure process for updating them.
3. WHEN credentials are rotated THEN the system SHALL ensure minimal disruption to the application.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and audit credential usage, so that I can ensure security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN credentials are accessed THEN the system SHALL log the access in a secure manner.
2. WHEN unauthorized access attempts occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators.
3. IF credentials are compromised THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism for immediate rotation.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want to prevent credential leakage in Git history, so that our repository remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL prevent credentials from being included in the commit.
2. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the system SHALL check for credential exposure.
3. IF credentials are detected in the repository THEN the system SHALL provide tools to remove them from the Git history.
