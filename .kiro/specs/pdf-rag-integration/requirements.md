# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing BusinessVoiceAgent with comprehensive PDF reading capabilities, document parsing functions, knowledge base integration, and a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. The system will process PDF documents from the company_pdfs directory and integrate them into the voice agent's knowledge base to provide more accurate and contextual responses without requiring ChromaDB or vector database implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to read and parse PDF documents from the company_pdfs directory, so that I can access structured information from company documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically scan the company_pdfs directory for PDF files
2. WHEN a PDF file is found THEN the system SHALL extract text content using appropriate parsing libraries
3. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL structure the content into searchable segments
4. IF a PDF file is corrupted or unreadable THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue processing other files
5. WHEN PDF processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store the parsed content in an accessible format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to implement document parsing functions that can handle different PDF structures, so that I can extract meaningful information from various document types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing FAQ documents THEN the system SHALL identify question-answer pairs
2. WHEN processing policy documents THEN the system SHALL extract sections and subsections with headers
3. WHEN processing procedure documents THEN the system SHALL identify step-by-step instructions
4. WHEN processing general documents THEN the system SHALL extract paragraphs and maintain document structure
5. IF document structure is unclear THEN the system SHALL fall back to basic text extraction
6. WHEN parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL tag content with document type and source information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to integrate parsed PDF content with my existing knowledge base, so that I can provide comprehensive responses using both static knowledge and document content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PDF content is parsed THEN the system SHALL merge it with existing JSON knowledge base files
2. WHEN duplicate information is detected THEN the system SHALL prioritize PDF content over static knowledge
3. WHEN knowledge base is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing queries
4. IF knowledge integration fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with existing knowledge base
5. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL provide unified access to all knowledge sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to implement a RAG system that can retrieve relevant information from parsed documents, so that I can provide accurate and contextual responses to user queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL search through parsed document content for relevant information
2. WHEN relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance and recency
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL combine retrieved information with LLM capabilities
4. IF no relevant content is found THEN the system SHALL fall back to general knowledge and existing responses
5. WHEN providing answers THEN the system SHALL cite the source document when appropriate
6. WHEN multiple sources contain relevant information THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from multiple documents

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want file upload and processing logic that can handle new PDF documents, so that the knowledge base can be updated without system restart.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new PDF file is added to company_pdfs directory THEN the system SHALL detect the change automatically
2. WHEN file change is detected THEN the system SHALL process the new document without interrupting ongoing conversations
3. WHEN processing new files THEN the system SHALL update the knowledge base incrementally
4. IF file processing fails THEN the system SHALL retry processing with exponential backoff
5. WHEN file processing is complete THEN the system SHALL log successful integration and make content available immediately
6. WHEN files are removed THEN the system SHALL remove corresponding content from the knowledge base

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to maintain conversation context while accessing document information, so that I can provide coherent and relevant responses throughout the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN retrieving document information THEN the system SHALL consider current conversation context
2. WHEN user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain reference to previously discussed documents
3. WHEN switching topics THEN the system SHALL adapt document search to new context
4. IF document information conflicts with conversation flow THEN the system SHALL prioritize conversation coherence
5. WHEN providing document-based answers THEN the system SHALL integrate them naturally into conversational responses

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to learn from conversations when users provide information not found in PDFs, so that I can continuously improve my knowledge base and provide better responses in future conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides new information during conversation THEN the system SHALL identify knowledge gaps in existing documents
2. WHEN user explicitly teaches the agent new information THEN the system SHALL store this learning with conversation context
3. WHEN similar questions arise in future conversations THEN the system SHALL incorporate learned information into responses
4. IF learned information conflicts with PDF content THEN the system SHALL prioritize PDF content but note the discrepancy
5. WHEN storing learned information THEN the system SHALL tag it with source conversation, timestamp, and confidence level
6. WHEN learned knowledge is used THEN the system SHALL indicate it was learned from previous conversations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a voice agent, I want to develop expertise in specific fields (healthcare, legal, technical support) based on document content and conversation patterns, so that I can provide specialized assistance tailored to the domain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL identify domain-specific terminology and concepts
2. WHEN engaging in conversations THEN the system SHALL adapt language and expertise level to the detected field
3. WHEN healthcare topics are discussed THEN the system SHALL prioritize medical documents and use appropriate medical terminology
4. WHEN legal questions arise THEN the system SHALL reference policy documents and use precise legal language
5. WHEN technical support is needed THEN the system SHALL focus on procedure manuals and provide step-by-step guidance
6. IF domain expertise is uncertain THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to determine the appropriate specialization level
