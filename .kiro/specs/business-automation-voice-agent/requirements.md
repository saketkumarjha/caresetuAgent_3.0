# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Business Automation Voice Agent is a LiveKit-based voice-powered system that automates customer support and appointment scheduling processes. The system leverages LiveKit's Agents framework with AssemblyAI's Universal-Streaming technology to provide accurate real-time speech recognition and processing, particularly excelling with proper nouns, business terminology, and complex multi-step workflows. Built on LiveKit Cloud infrastructure, this solution provides production-ready scalability and telephony integration for B2B/B2C applications.
