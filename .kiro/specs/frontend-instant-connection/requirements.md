# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a web browser frontend that provides instant connection capabilities with the existing voice agent backend. The frontend will offer clear error reporting, giving users visibility into specific backend issues like latency, connection failures, token expiration, and LLM overload.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the voice agent through a web browser, so that I can interact with the AI agent easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the web application THEN the system SHALL display a simple interface with a microphone button
2. WHEN a user clicks connect THEN the system SHALL establish backend connection within 3 seconds
3. WHEN the connection is established THEN the system SHALL display "Connected" status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see specific error messages when backend problems occur, so that I know exactly what's wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend latency exceeds 1 seconds THEN the system SHALL display "High latency - slow response"
2. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL display "Connection lost"
3. WHEN authentication token expires THEN the system SHALL display "Token expired - refresh needed"
4. WHEN the LLM service is overloaded THEN the system SHALL display "AI service overloaded"
5. WHEN network fails THEN the system SHALL display "Network error"
6. WHEN backend server is down THEN the system SHALL display "Backend server unavailable"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use voice interactions with the AI agent, so that I can have conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the microphone button THEN the system SHALL start recording audio
2. WHEN a user speaks THEN the system SHALL send audio to backend
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL play the audio response
4. WHEN microphone permissions are denied THEN the system SHALL display "Microphone access required"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to connect to the voice agent deployed on Render.com, so that users can interact with the deployed agent through LiveKit WebRTC.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend connects THEN the system SHALL connect to LiveKit WebRTC using the configured LiveKit URL
2. WHEN authentication is needed THEN the system SHALL use LiveKit tokens generated by the existing token generation script
3. WHEN the agent is deployed on Render.com THEN the frontend SHALL connect through LiveKit to the Render-hosted agent instance
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them for debugging
